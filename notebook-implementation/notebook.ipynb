    "2. ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS:\n",
    "   - If the user's request lacks sufficient detail, ask 2-3 focused questions to better understand:\n",
    "     * Their background and expertise level\n",
    "     * Their specific goals for the research\n",
    "     * Any particular aspects they want to emphasize\n",
    "     * Intended audience and purpose of the report\n",
    "   - Prioritize questions that will significantly impact the report structure\n",
    "\n",
    "3. GENERATE A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT STRUCTURE:\n",
    "   - Create a detailed, hierarchical structure with:\n",
    "     * Clear main sections (typically 5-12 depending on topic complexity)\n",
    "     * Relevant subsections under each main section\n",
    "     * Logical flow from introduction to conclusion\n",
    "   - Adapt the structure to match the specific research type:\n",
    "     * For learning/exploration topics: progress from fundamentals to advanced concepts\n",
    "     * For comparison topics: use parallel structure across compared items\n",
    "     * For data source exploration: organize by data types, sources, and methodologies\n",
    "     * For implementation topics: follow a logical sequence from setup to advanced usage\n",
    "   - Ensure the structure is comprehensive but focused on the user's specific needs\n",
    "\n",
    "4. FORMAT THE RESPONSE:\n",
    "   - Present the report structure as a hierarchical outline with clear section numbering\n",
    "   - Use descriptive titles for each section and subsection\n",
    "   - Include brief descriptions of key sections when helpful\n",
    "   - Provide the structure in a clean, easy-to-read format\n",
    "\n",
    "5. OFFER FOLLOW-UP ASSISTANCE:\n",
    "   - Ask if any sections need adjustment or elaboration\n",
    "   - Suggest specific modifications if you identify potential improvements\n",

    "## Query Generation Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Initial Runs (no previous_queries or reflection_feedback):\n",
    "1. Analyze the section name and all subsection descriptions thoroughly\n",
    "2. Identify the core concepts, key terms, and relationships that need to be researched\n",
    "3. Prioritize fundamental information needs first\n",
    "4. Create specific, targeted queries for the most important information\n",
    "5. Ensure coverage across all subsections, but prioritize depth over breadth\n",
    "6. Include technical terminology and domain-specific language when appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Subsequent Runs (with reflection_feedback):\n",
    "1. Carefully analyze the reflection feedback to understand information gaps\n",
    "2. Prioritize queries that address the specific missing information\n",
    "3. Avoid generating queries too similar to previous_queries\n",
    "4. Create more specialized or alternative phrasings to find the missing information\n",
    "5. Use more technical or specific terminology if general queries were insufficient\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query Construction Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specificity**: Create targeted queries that are likely to return relevant results\n",
    "   - Include specific technical terms rather than general descriptions\n",
    "   - Incorporate domain knowledge and specialized terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Diversity**: Ensure variety in your query approaches\n",
    "   - Vary query structure (questions, keyword sets, specific facts to verify)\n",
    "   - Target different aspects of the subsections\n",
    "   - Include different perspectives or viewpoints when relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prioritization**: Order queries by importance\n",
    "   - Place queries for fundamental or critical information first\n",
    "   - Prioritize queries addressing explicit reflection feedback\n",
    "   - Ensure the most important subsections are covered in the limited query count\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Effectiveness**: Optimize for search engine performance\n",
    "   - Use search operators when helpful (quotes for exact phrases, etc.)\n",
    "   - Keep queries concise but descriptive (typically 4-10 words)\n",
    "   - Include year/recency indicators for time-sensitive topics\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: The most important queries should come first in your list, as the system may only use a subset of your generated queries based on the user's `max_queries` setting.\n",

Importance of Support Vector Machines\\nSupport Vector Machines (SVMs) represent a robust class of supervised learning algorithms particularly effective for classification tasks. The importance of SVMs can be attributed to their ability to manage high-dimensional data, their resilience against overfitting, and their effectiveness in both linear and non-linear classification scenarios. SVMs excel in high-dimensional spaces, making them suitable for applications such as image classification and bioinformatics.\\n\\n### 1.3.

By synthesizing existing knowledge and research, the report seeks to enhance understanding of SVMs and their role in modern machine learning.\\n\\n## 2. Fundamentals of Support Vector Machines\\n\\n### 2.1. Definition of Support Vector Machines\\nSupport Vector Machines are defined as machine learning algorithms that aim to find the hyperplane which maximizes the margin between two classes of data points. The SVM algorithm\\'s primary goal is to maximize the margin, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class, known as support vectors.\\n\\n### 2.2. Key Concepts\\n\\n#### 2.2.1. Hyperplanes\\nA hyperplane serves as the decision boundary that separates different classes in the feature space. In a two-dimensional space, this hyperplane is a line, while in three dimensions, it becomes a plane.\\n\\n#### 2.2.2. Support Vectors\\nSupport vectors are the data points that lie closest to the hyperplane. They are pivotal in defining both the margin and the hyperplane itself.\\n\\n#### 2.2.3. Margin\\nThe margin is defined as the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest support vectors from either class. SVMs strive to maximize this margin, which enhances the model\\'s ability to generalize to unseen data.\\n\\n### 2.3. Types of SVM\\n\\n#### 2.3.1. Linear SVM\\nLinear SVMs are applicable when the data is linearly separable, meaning that a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) can effectively separate the classes.\\n\\n#### 2.3.2. Non-Linear SVM\\nNon-Linear SVMs are employed when the data is not linearly separable. These models utilize kernel functions to map input features into a higher-dimensional space, allowing for the creation of a hyperplane that can effectively separate the classes.\\n\\n## 3. Mathematical Foundations\\n\\n### 3.1. Optimization Problem\\nAt the heart of SVMs is the optimization problem, which seeks to identify the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes in the dataset. The optimization problem can be formulated with an objective function and constraints that ensure correct classification.\\n\\n### 3.2. Cost Function\\nThe cost function quantifies the error in the model\\'s predictions and guides the optimization algorithm toward the optimal hyperplane. It typically includes a regularization parameter that balances margin maximization and classification errors.\\n\\n### 3.3. Kernel Trick\\nThe kernel trick is a powerful technique that enables SVMs to operate in higher-dimensional spaces without explicitly transforming the data. Common kernel functions include linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) kernels.\\n\\n#### 3.3.1. Types of Kernels\\n\\n##### 3.3.1.1. Linear Kernel\\nSuitable for linearly separable data.\\n\\n##### 3.3.1.2. Polynomial Kernel\\nAllows for polynomial decision boundaries.\\n\\n##### 3.3.1.3. Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel\\nEffective for non-linear data distributions.\\n\\n## 4. Training Support Vector Machines\\n\\n### 4.1. Data Preparation\\nData preparation is critical in the SVM training process, involving data collection, cleaning, feature selection, scaling, and splitting into training, validation, and test sets.\\n\\n### 4.2. Training Process\\nThe training process involves selecting the kernel, setting hyperparameters, and optimizing the model to find the optimal hyperplane.\\n\\n### 4.3. Model Evaluation\\n\\n#### 4.3.1. Cross-Validation\\nCross-validation techniques, such as K-Fold, ensure that the model is evaluated on different data segments.\\n\\n#### 4.3.2. Performance Metrics\\nVarious metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC, are used to evaluate model performance.\\n\\n## 5. Applications of Support Vector Machines\\n\\n### 5.1. Classification Tasks\\nSVMs are predominantly recognized for their prowess in classification problems, including text classification, image recognition, and bioinformatics.\\n\\n### 5.2. Regression Tasks\\nSupport Vector Regression (SVR) is utilized to predict continuous outcomes, effectively modeling complex, non-linear relationships.\\n\\n### 5.3. Anomaly Detection\\nSVMs are effective in identifying rare events or observations that deviate from the norm, particularly through one-class SVMs.\\n\\n### 5.4. Real-World Use Cases\\nSVMs have applications across various industries, including healthcare for medical diagnosis, finance for credit scoring, and marketing for customer segmentation.\\n\\n## 6. Advantages and Limitations of SVM\\n\\n### 6.1. Advantages\\nSVMs are effective in high-dimensional spaces, robust to overfitting, versatile through kernel functions, and grounded in strong theoretical foundations.\\n\\n### 6.2. Limitations\\nChallenges include computational complexity, sensitivity to parameter selection, and difficulties with imbalanced data.\\n\\n### 6.3. Comparison with Other Machine Learning Algorithms\\nSVMs are compared with decision trees, neural networks, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, and random forests, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n## 7. Conclusion\\n\\n### 7.1. Summary of Key Points\\nThis report has explored the foundational principles and operational mechanics of Support Vector Machines, emphasizing their significance in machine learning.\\n\\n### 7.2. Future Directions in SVM Research\\nFuture research may focus on scalability improvements, hybrid models, kernel function innovations, unsupervised learning applications, real-time processing, and addressing ethical considerations in AI.\\n\\n## 8.
